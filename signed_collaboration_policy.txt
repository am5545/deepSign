        I have read and understood the following documents:

          1. CS department's Policies and Procedures regarding Academic Honesty;
          2. Columbia College and Columbia Engineeringâ€™s Academic Integrity website; and
          3. The policies of this course.

        I pledge that I will abide by the rules set forth by the documents, and
        that I will accept the corresponding penalties if I fail to do so.

        I also pledge that I will never post any Course Materials to public code
        repositories or web sites like GitHub, CourseHero, etc., nor will I
        share Course Materials privately with any person who may take the same
        class in the future.  I understand Course Materials include, but are not
        limited to, my own code, skeleton and solution code I received, lecture
        notes, and exams and solutions.
